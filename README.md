## üÜò Help needed

> [!NOTE]
Currently, I am [rewriting DownOnSpot](https://github.com/oSumAtrIX/DownOnSpot/pull/68).  
If you want to help me accelerate this process, please feel free to contact me at [osumatrix.me](https://osumatrix.me).

## ‚≠ê Features

- ‚úÖ Actually downloads from Spotify, free and premium
- ‚úÖ Chose between 96, 160, 256 and 320 kbit/s (free users can't exceed 160kbit/s)
- ‚úÖ Download tracks, playlists, albums and artists
- ‚úÖ Multi-threaded
- ‚úÖ Search for tracks
- ‚úÖ Download MP3 and original OGG files
- ‚úÖ Metadata tagging
- ‚úÖ Simple CLI interface

> [!NOTE]
> Free Spotify users can not exceed 160kbit/s. Change the `quality` setting in the `settings.json` file to `Q160` or lower. If you want to download 256 or 320kbit/s, you need to use a premium account.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Building

1. Clone the repository using git and change to the local repository directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oSumAtrIX/DownOnSpot.git
   cd DownOnSpot
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   If you are on Linux, make sure you have the `libasound2-dev` package installed.  
   Additionally, you need the [libmp3lame](https://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-libraries.php#libmp3lame) library.  
   On Mac OS, run `brew install lame`, provided you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

3. Build

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not want to use `free-librespot` (i.e. if you are using a paid Spotify account), replace `git = "ssh://git@github.com/oSumAtrIX/free-librespot.git"` with `librespot = "0.4.2"` inside the `Cargo.toml` file.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

1. Create a [new application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) on the Spotify developer dashboard
2. Run DownOnSpot

   ```bash
   $ ./down_on_spot
   Settings could not be loaded because of the following error: IO: NotFound No such file or directory. (os error 2)...
   ..but default settings have been created successfully. Edit them and run the program again.
   ```

3. Edit the `settings.json` file

   The `settings.json` file is located in the following directories:

   - Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\down_on_spot\settings.json`
   - Unix: `~/.config/down_on_spot/settings.json`

üéâ Now you can use DownOnSpot

   ```bash
   $ ./down_on_spot
   Usage:
   down_on_spot.exe <search_term> | <track_url> | <album_url> | <playlist_url> | <artist_url>
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Template variables

You can use the following template variables for `path` and `filename_template` in the `settings.json` file:

- %0disc%
- %0track%
- %album%
- %albumArtist%
- %albumArtists%
- %artist%
- %disc%
- %id%
- %title%
- %track%
